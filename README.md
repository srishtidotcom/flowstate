## 📌 What We're Building

Flowstate is an AI-powered workflow orchestration system that converts unstructured communication (WhatsApp exports, emails, meeting transcripts, screenshots) into structured, actionable task workflows — running locally via Ollama.

We're currently in the **build phase**, implementing the full 11-phase architecture described in the system design. This README tracks our progress, setup steps, and build process end-to-end.

> **Inference Strategy:** We're using **Ollama as the primary runtime** throughout phases 0–11. Lemonade integration will be explored as a performance optimization layer after all phases are complete and stable.

# Optional: Calendar integration
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./credentials/google_calendar.json
```

---

## 📦 Installation

### Step 4 — Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key packages being installed:
```
fastapi uvicorn
sqlalchemy alembic psycopg2-binary
chromadb
redis
sentence-transformers
pypdf2 python-docx pillow
celery
networkx                  # DAG graph engine
httpx
pydantic
python-multipart
```

### Step 5 — Install Node.js Dependencies (Frontend)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 6 — Install and Configure Ollama (Primary Inference Runtime)

Ollama is our primary inference runtime throughout all build phases.

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull the primary text model
ollama pull mistral

# Pull the vision model (for screenshot parsing in Phase 2)
ollama pull llava

# Start the Ollama server
ollama serve
```

Ollama exposes an OpenAI-compatible API at `http://localhost:11434` — no code changes needed.

Verify it's running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

> **Note on Lemonade:** AMD's Lemonade runtime will be evaluated as a future optimization layer once all 11 phases are fully built and stable on Ollama. No Lemonade setup is required at this stage.

### Step 7 — Install Sentence Transformers (Embeddings)

```bash
python -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')"
```

This will download the MiniLM model (~80 MB) on first run.

### Step 8 — Start Infrastructure Services via Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres chromadb redis
```

This starts:
- **PostgreSQL** on port `5432` — structured task/graph storage
- **ChromaDB** on port `8000` — vector store for embeddings
- **Redis** on port `6379` — async message queue

Verify they're running:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### Step 9 — Run Database Migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

This sets up all tables: `tasks`, `owners`, `deadlines`, `graph_edges`, `confidence_scores`, `version_history`.

---

## 🏗️ Build Process

Here's the full step-by-step build sequence we're following, phase by phase.

---

### Phase 0 — Inference Runtime Layer 🔨 In Progress / Testing

**Goal:** Set up the Ollama inference layer that powers all extraction.

```bash
# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# Pull the Mistral-7B model
ollama pull mistral:7b-instruct

# Test the endpoint
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "mistral:7b-instruct", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
```

Validate the response includes the model's reply to your prompt:

```json
{
  "model": "mistral:7b-instruct",
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Hi! How can I help?"
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- Ollama runs on `http://localhost:11434` by default.
- No GPU required — CPU inference works out of the box.
- Logs are printed to the terminal. Redirect to `logs/ollama.log` if needed:
  ```bash
  ollama serve >> logs/ollama.log 2>&1
  ```

---

### Phase 1 — Ingestion Layer 🔨 In Progress / Testing

**Goal:** Accept file uploads and push them into an async processing queue.

Build the upload API endpoint:

```python
# backend/ingestion/upload.py
@router.post("/upload")
async def upload_file(file: UploadFile, team_id: str):
    # Save raw file to object store
    # Push metadata to Redis stream
    # Return job_id
```

Supported input formats: `.txt` (WhatsApp), `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.png`/`.jpg` (screenshots), `.json` (Discord).

Test ingestion:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/upload \
  -F "file=@sample_chat.txt" \
  -F "team_id=team_alpha"
```

Set up Redis Stream consumer:
```bash
# Start the worker
celery -A backend.worker worker --loglevel=info
```

---

### Phase 2 — Multimodal Preprocessing Layer 🔨 In Progress / Testing

**Goal:** Normalize all input types into clean, chunked text with speaker metadata.

Build the content normalizer:

```python
# backend/preprocessing/normalizer.py

def normalize(file_path: str, file_type: str) -> list[Chunk]:
    if file_type == "txt":
        return chunk_by_speaker(file_path)
    elif file_type == "pdf":
        return extract_pdf_text(file_path)
    elif file_type in ["png", "jpg"]:
        return extract_image_text_via_vision(file_path)  # calls LLaVA via Ollama
    elif file_type == "docx":
        return extract_docx_text(file_path)
```

For image/screenshot inputs, the vision model (LLaVA via Ollama) extracts text, tables, and UI labels using OCR + layout-aware parsing.

Test preprocessing:
```bash
python -m backend.preprocessing.normalizer --file sample_screenshot.png
```

---

### Phase 3 — Structured Extraction Engine 🔨 In Progress / Testing

**Goal:** Extract tasks, owners, deadlines, and dependencies from normalized chunks using schema-enforced LLM output.

This is the **core intelligence layer**. We're using strict JSON schema enforcement so the LLM never returns malformed output:

```python
TASK_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "task":         { "type": "string" },
        "owner":        { "type": ["string", "null"] },
        "deadline":     { "type": ["string", "null"] },
        "dependencies": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "confidence":   { "type": "number" },
        "source_ref":   { "type": "string" }
    },
    "required": ["task", "confidence", "source_ref"]
}
```

The system prompt includes few-shot examples covering:
- Clean task with explicit owner
- Implicit deadline ("by end of day Friday")
- Task with dependency chain
- Task with no owner identified

Test extraction:
```bash
python -m backend.extraction.extractor --chunk "Rahul can you finish the pitch deck by Thursday evening?"
# Expected: {task: "Complete pitch deck", owner: "Rahul", deadline: "Thursday evening", confidence: 0.94}
```

---

### Phase 4 — Intelligence Enrichment ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Fill gaps in extracted data — infer missing owners, normalize deadline formats, detect duplicates.

**Ownership Inference:**
When `owner == null`, use historical ownership mapping and speaker activity frequency to assign `inferred_owner` with `inference_confidence`.

**Deadline Normalization:**
Convert relative times to absolute ISO timestamps:
```python
"Next Friday" → "2026-03-27T23:59:00+05:30"
"EOD"         → "2026-03-24T18:00:00+05:30"
```

**Duplicate Detection:**
Before inserting a new task, compare its embedding against all existing task embeddings in ChromaDB. If cosine similarity exceeds the threshold AND owner/deadline overlap — flag as duplicate candidate.

```bash
# Test enrichment pipeline end-to-end
python -m backend.enrichment.pipeline --task-id <task_id>
```

---

### Phase 5 — Task Graph Intelligence (DAG Engine) ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Model tasks as a directed acyclic graph to surface dependencies, bottlenecks, and critical path.

```python
import networkx as nx

G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_node("task_001", label="Design wireframes", deadline="2026-03-25")
G.add_node("task_002", label="Build frontend", deadline="2026-03-28")
G.add_edge("task_001", "task_002")  # frontend depends on wireframes

critical_path = nx.dag_longest_path(G)
bottlenecks   = [n for n in G.nodes if G.in_degree(n) > 2]
```

Store graph edges in PostgreSQL (adjacency list) and cache in memory for fast traversal.

Test graph builder:
```bash
python -m backend.graph.builder --transcript-id <id>
```

---

### Phase 6 — AI Governance Layer ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Route low-confidence extractions to a human review queue. Build trust into every task.

```python
def route_task(task: ExtractedTask):
    if task.confidence < 0.75 or task.inference_confidence < 0.70 or task.is_duplicate_candidate:
        send_to_review_queue(task)
    else:
        auto_approve(task)
```

Every task carries:
- Confidence score (0–1)
- Source snippet reference (exact chat line)
- Inference trace (how the owner was determined)

Build the review queue API:
```bash
GET  /api/review-queue          # List tasks needing human review
POST /api/review-queue/:id/approve
POST /api/review-queue/:id/edit
```

---

### Phase 7 — Hybrid Memory Architecture ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Persist all data across three complementary stores.

| Store | Technology | What It Stores |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Structured | PostgreSQL | Tasks, owners, deadlines, graph edges, version history |
| Vector | ChromaDB | Task embeddings, conversation embeddings, document embeddings |
| Object | Local FS / S3-compatible | Raw transcripts, uploaded files, OCR outputs |

Verify all three are operational:
```bash
# PostgreSQL
psql -h localhost -U flowstate_user -d flowstate -c "\dt"

# ChromaDB
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/heartbeat

# Object store
ls ./storage/objects/
```

---

### Phase 8 — Automation Layer ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Trigger real-world actions idempotently when tasks are approved.

For each approved task with a deadline:
1. Add event to Google Calendar
2. Create card on Kanban board
3. Send reminder notification to owner
4. Emit event on internal event bus

Idempotency check before every action:
```python
task_hash = sha256(f"{task_id}:{owner}:{deadline}".encode()).hexdigest()
if already_processed(task_hash):
    return  # Skip — already triggered
```

Test automation:
```bash
python -m backend.automation.trigger --task-id <id>
```

Set up Google Calendar credentials:
```bash
# Place OAuth credentials at:
./credentials/google_calendar.json

# Run auth flow (first time only)
python scripts/auth_calendar.py
```

---

### Phase 9 — Dashboard & Visualization Layer ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Build the frontend task board with DAG view and source trust popovers.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3000
```

Frontend components to build:
- **Task Board** — AI-generated tasks, editable fields, confidence badge
- **Dependency Graph** — Cytoscape.js DAG with critical path in red, bottlenecks flagged
- **Trust Popover** — Click any task → shows extracted source chat snippet + line reference + confidence score

Build the graph view:
```bash
npm install cytoscape
```

```javascript
// frontend/graph-view/DagView.jsx
import cytoscape from 'cytoscape';
// Render nodes (tasks) and edges (dependencies)
// Color critical path red
// Flag high-in-degree nodes as bottlenecks
```

---

### Phase 10 — Continuous Learning & Evaluation ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Measure extraction quality and improve the system over time.

**Human Feedback Loop:**
When a user edits an AI-generated task (owner, deadline, wording), store the diff:
```python
{
    "original": { "owner": null, "deadline": "Friday" },
    "edited":   { "owner": "Siya", "deadline": "2026-03-27T17:00:00" },
    "task_id": "task_042"
}
```

Use diffs to refine system prompts and recalibrate confidence thresholds.

**Synthetic Dataset Generator:**
```bash
python scripts/synthetic_gen.py --count 200 --output data/synthetic_hackathon.json
```

Generates simulated chat transcripts with known ground-truth tasks.

**Evaluation:**
```bash
python scripts/eval.py --dataset data/synthetic_hackathon.json
```

Outputs:
```
Precision: 0.941
Recall:    0.928
F1 Score:  0.934
```

Target: **F1 ≥ 0.90** before final submission.

---

### Phase 11 — Containerized Deployment ⬜ Not Started

**Goal:** Package the entire system into a one-command deployable stack.

Build all Docker images:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

Start everything:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

Services started:

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Backend API | 8001 | FastAPI app |
| Frontend | 3000 | React dashboard |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 | Structured DB |
| ChromaDB | 8000 | Vector store |
| Redis | 6379 | Queue |
| Ollama | 11434 | LLM inference |

Full teardown:
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## ▶️ Running the System

Once all phases are built:

```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d postgres chromadb redis

# 2. Start inference runtime
ollama serve

# 3. Start backend
uvicorn backend.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload

# 4. Start Celery worker (async jobs)
celery -A backend.worker worker --loglevel=info

# 5. Start frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the dashboard.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run extraction accuracy eval
python scripts/eval.py --dataset data/synthetic_hackathon.json

# Test a single file end-to-end
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/upload \
  -F "file=@tests/fixtures/sample_whatsapp.txt" \
  -F "team_id=test_team"
```

---

## 🐳 Deployment

For demo deployment:

```bash
# One-command deploy
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

No cloud dependency required — runs entirely locally.

## 🗺️ Roadmap — Post Phase 11

Once all phases are complete and stable on Ollama, we plan to explore:

- **Lemonade integration** — AMD's hybrid NPU/iGPU/CPU inference runtime as a drop-in performance layer over the existing Ollama-compatible API
- **Model benchmarking** — Compare latency and throughput between Ollama and Lemonade on equivalent hardware
- **Selective offloading** — Route high-frequency extraction tasks to Lemonade while keeping Ollama as fallback

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Vision extraction (Phase 2) is slow without a GPU; LLaVA via Ollama on CPU can be sluggish for large screenshots
- Google Calendar integration requires manual OAuth setup (one-time)
- Redis stream backpressure not yet handled for large batch uploads
